Team Presence Hours

Do you have the feeling that, although you as a team are sitting in the same room, you have trouble getting the communication and collaboration flowing? The reason could be that although you sit together you are not actually all there at the same time during the day. 

To explore this, paint a graph where each person plots when he/she typically arrives, is away for lunch and is off to recurring meetings. Or even better, record actual data over a two week period. This might reveal opportunities to reschedule some meetings, or others might consider arriving earlier or later. 

If the team is dis-located, people might even be spread out across different time zones, then this can be very useful and valuable to map out.
