Bonus: How to peel a post-it

This might appear to be a stupid tip, who would need to learn how to peel a Post-it from a Post-it deck?

Well, quite many people it seems. To avoid curly Post-its that don’t hang flat on the wall, lift the Post-it slightly with a firm grip and pull it down. Ta da!

If holding the thumb on the side of the deck doesn’t work for you (as shown in the lower right corner) try position the left thumb on top of the stack, under the Post-it you are about to pull.
