Out of office

I’ve seen some teams dedicate a small area of the team wall to show where people are if they are not at the office.

As soon as someone learns that a person is sick, working offsite (conference, course, etc.), on vacation, or home doing VAB, the person’s avatar is moved to the corresponding slot.

Additional information can of course be added on Post-its, for example: when will the person be back from vacation.

Note: VAB is perhaps very Swedish… it means “Getting paid for staying at home taking care of my sick kid”.
