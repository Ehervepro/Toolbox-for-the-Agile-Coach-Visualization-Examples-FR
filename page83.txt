Race Track

Instead of punishing late-comers to the Daily Stand-up, why not reward those that are on time by allowing them to move their figure one step forward on the race track? The person that has come the furthest on the race track by the end of the sprint wins an applaud and a group hug. A race like this could also focus on other behaviors and actions, such asâ€¦

Resolving blockers
Getting committed code reviewed
Executing retrospective actions
Finishing tasks
Reviewing code

Either the winner chooses the rules of the next race, or the team decides this together during the Sprint Planning.
