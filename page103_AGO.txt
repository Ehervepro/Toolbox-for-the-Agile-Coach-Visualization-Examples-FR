Dependancy Board

When a team discovers that they need something from another team (in order to begin their own work), they add that to the shared Dependency Board. “We need <red> before we can start with <yellow>”. The notes are connected with a string.

The board is regularly reviewed by the teams, for instance during the Scrum of Scrums. Once a red note has been resolved the connected yellow Post-its is removed as well.

The Dependency Board can help teams to plan, slice features, foresee needed technical collaboration, as well as finding alternative ways of helping each other.
