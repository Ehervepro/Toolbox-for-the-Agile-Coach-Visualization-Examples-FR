User Story Flavor Legend

Some teams find it useful to distinguish between different types of user stories. Not all prioritized work fit the typical customer value focused User Story template. 

Instead of forcing yourselves to write a weird card using User Story format for a patch release or a time boxed investigation or experiment, allow simpler templates when working with non-user centric stories. Make the different flavors of User Stories clear by the use of colors and add the colors to your wall legend.
