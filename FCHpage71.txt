Limit by Space

If your team does Kanban or some version of Scrumban and have a hard time honoring the WIP Limits you have set for yourselves, perhaps this approach can help you.

Instead of writing the WIP Limits, adjust the spaces. Make the boxes and areas containing the Post-its so small that you canâ€™t physically fit more Post-its than the space allows without breaking the WIP Limit.
 
This approach also makes it bluntly obvious if the WIP Limit has been broken somewhere, just look for Post-its stacked upon each other.
